    <h2 class="sub-heading">How to Make Turkey Burgers</h2>
    <p>
      The good news is that making turkey burgers from scratch is quite easy.
      All you need is ground turkey, onion, bread crumbs, eggs, and some
      seasonings and you're good to go. Simply combine your ground turkey, diced
      onion, bread crumbs, egg whites, garlic, parsley, salt, and ground pepper
      in a bowl. We recommend sticking with ground turkey that's about 93% lean
      or less — any leaner than that and your burger might fall apart. Form the
      ground turkey mixture into patties and cook the burgers using your
      preferred method.
